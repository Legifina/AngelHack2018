Analyzing MetaMask wallets to score investors

Hello Everyone.
Meet Nabila: Since she’s been telling her about the bitcoin buzz, she’s willing to share the news with her her friends and family on social networks.
Unfortunately, since the French monetary regulation authority AMF is highly concerned with citizens savings, they had to remind her the thin line between risk and foolishness!
The egalitarian world would give Nabila real time access to your brains in order to help her separate disruption from scams.
That’s the reason why Legifina Machine Learning gives her access to a one click curated financial insights from your effective investment strategies.
Our peer-to-peer application exchanges her anonymized and locally calculated performance score to aggregate a tokens ranking.
What’s more, Nabila can send a Request For Quotation to any crypto investors from the scorecard.
Thus, professional investors with more historical trades willing to access a faster multi tenancy computation, can pay for a premium faster version.
Thanks to Legifina, Nabila and her followers just got empowered with a more accurate version of Bloomberg news thanks to the best of both worlds: crowdsourced data and AI.
